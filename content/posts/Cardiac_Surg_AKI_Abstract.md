## Summary  
This study presents REACT, a causal deep learning model designed to predict cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) up to 48 hours in advance using just six routine inputs. The model was trained on multicentre time-series datasets and validated externally, including U.S. cohorts, showing earlier detection (≈16 hours before guidelines) and superior performance compared to standard deep learning approaches. REACT’s reliance on only six causal factors—age, creatinine, BUN, uric acid, LDH, and CK—makes it feasible for bedside or EHR deployment, even in resource-limited settings. While promising, its evaluation remains largely retrospective, requiring prospective validation and careful local calibration.
